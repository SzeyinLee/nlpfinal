Summary:
Classifying Chinese and English Vocabulary Based on International Phonetic Alphabet 

1) Plan:
We will build a naive bayes Chinese/English vocabulary phoetic classifier. Treating each 
IPA alphabet as an independent feature, we will pre-process data of English vocab and
Chinese vocab into IPA forms, and train the model on the data. It's supervised machine
learning because we already know the label for each data point. 

This will be our baseline model and we are planning to explore some extensions such as:
- using bi-grams from the IPA alphabet for the naive bayes model 
- looking into other models such as support vector machine
- compare results from all the extensions

2) Experiment: 
We will reserve part of the Chinese and English IPA data to be the testing data set. We will
run the classifier on the testing set, and see how many vocabularies were classified 
correctly (baseline is 50%).
